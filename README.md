# HauntedMaze
First top-down pixel art game developed using Godot

You as the player are at the start of a mysterious maze out in the middle of the woods. It’s dark, and you can barely see what’s in your immediate surroundings due to this heavy, inescapable fog; it’s almost suffocating. Your objective is to get out, to reach the exit of this maze. However, something feels off; the maze is haunted. You will have to traverse said maze with caution as to avoid coming into contact with one of the many spirits wandering throughout.

## How to Run

1. `git clone` the project

2. open the `/builds` folder, and open the latest version folder, then your respective OS folder

3. run the `HauntedMaze.exe` file and have fun!
